# 🧊 HyperCube

Welcome to **HyperCube** — the ultra-fast, cube-slamming, laser-dodging, combo-chasing chaos engine where every frame is a war crime against geometry.

## 🚀 How to Play

- **You are the Cyan Cube.**
- **MOVE FAST** and **SLAM INTO ENEMIES** to eliminate them.
- Gain points, dodge lasers, and don't let geometry commit violence on you first.

### 🕹️ Controls

| Action         | Key             |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Move           | Arrow Keys / WASD |
| Heal           | Spacebar (Consumes 10,000 Score) |
| Exit Game      | ESC             |

## 💥 Enemies

- 🔴 **Red Cubes** – Chase you like your worst mistakes.
- 🟩 **Green Rectangles** – Camp on walls and fire lasers. They are cowards.
- 🟨 **Yellow Triangles** – Invincible unless your combo is at least **x6**. Git gud.

## 💚 Healing

Press **Spacebar** to spend **10,000 points** and spawn a bouncing **pink cube** (like a low-poly Mario Superstar on estrogen). Touch it to heal to full HP and explode in particles like an angry Valentine.

## 📈 Score System

- Every kill adds points.
- When you gain points:
  - Score number gets BIG.
  - A floating **`+X Pts!`** message pops up for dramatic flair.

- Combos
 -Every kill gives you x1 combo
 -Every combo adds x2 to your next points (Ex: 100 goes to 200, 200 to 400 and so on)
 -Combo = Fun

## 🔮 Features

- Ultra-fluid movement
- Glorious afterimages
- Over-the-top particle effects
- Stylish healing mechanic
- A main menu (so you know it's legit)

## 🔧 Built With

- **Microsoft Visual Studio** (because speed is love, and love is JavaScript)
